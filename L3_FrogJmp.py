'''
A small frog wants to get to the other side of the road. The frog is currently 
located at position X and wants to get to a position greater than or equal to 
Y. The small frog always jumps a fixed distance, D.

Count the minimal number of jumps that the small frog must perform to reach 
its target.

Write a function:

def solution(X, Y, D)
that, given three integers X, Y and D, returns the minimal number of jumps from 
position X to a position equal to or greater than Y.

For example, given:

  X = 10
  Y = 85
  D = 30
the function should return 3, because the frog will be positioned as follows:

after the first jump, at position 10 + 30 = 40
after the second jump, at position 10 + 30 + 30 = 70
after the third jump, at position 10 + 30 + 30 + 30 = 100
Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

X, Y and D are integers within the range [1..1,000,000,000];
X â‰¤ Y.

X = 1000
Y = 100020
D = 50

def solution(X,Y,D):
    return(math.ceil((Y-X)/D))
